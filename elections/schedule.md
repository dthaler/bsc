# eBPF Steering Committee elections schedule

This process is derived from the [eBPF Foundation Charter][charter].

Each year, the BSC prepares to nominate a portion of its members according to
the following schedule:

| Milestone    | Target Date  |
| -------------| ------------ |
| Nominations  | August       |
| Election     | September    |
| New BSC sits | October      |

## Nominations

The Charter ยง4.b describes the composition of the voting members of the BSC
based around the projects that they are actively involved in. Broadly speaking,
these are comprised of active contributors to specific projects nominated by
the BSC under categories defined by the Charter. The BSC coordinates with
individual eBPF projects in order to nominate individuals to represent the eBPF
community in the BSC.

The nomination process is intended to identify projects and individuals whose
input will further the goals of the BSC as outlined in the Charter ยง4.b. Part
of this process involves selecting projects from which to draw individuals, and
part of this process involves nominating individuals from those projects. There
is no strict order between these two portions of the nomination phase.

## Election

The outcome of the nominations is a set of people who represent categories of
voting members in the Charter ยง4.b. The chair will call for an election during
September to select members to join the BSC in the following term, conducting
voting as per the Charter ยง5, typically during a regularly scheduled BSC
meeting.

## New BSC sits

Following the election of new members for the BSC, this repository should be
updated to reflect the results of the election and the new membership.
